## Bio
Tim Draper is a bitcoin investor and the founding partner of two venture capital firms started in 1985. Draper Fisher Jurvetson (DFJ) is focused on early- and growth-stage investments in enterprise, consumer and disruptive technologies, and includes Coinbase, Twitter and Patreon in its portfolio. Draper Associates concentrates on  seed-stage investments in companies such as Hashrabbit and Nutmeg. 

In July 2014, Draper was the winner of the auction of nearly 30,000 bitcoins that were seized from the black market website Silk Road by U.S. marshals. He has made a number of predictions about the rise of the bitcoin currency, stating in 2014, for example, that a bitcoin would be worth $10K by 2018.

Draper supports young entrepreneurs, including through his education program, the Draper University of Heroes. He also started BizWorld.org in 1997, a non-profit for children to learn entrepreneurship. 

Prior to founding DFJ and Draper Associates, Draper spent two years at investment bank Alex, Brown & Sons. He holds a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University and an MBA from Harvard. 

In 2014 Draper filed a petition to divide California into six “startup” states that would compete for citizens and businesses. However, the petition did not gather the required signatures.
