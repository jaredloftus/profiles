## Bio
Paris Hilton has earned her fame through appearing in several television shows and starring in movies throughout the years. She initially starred in a show with Nicole Richie titled The Simple Life, which aired from 2003 – 2005 and has made appearances in several movies such as Repo! The Genetic Opera (2008) and House of Wax (2005). She has also branded herself through modelling, perfume launches, introducing a new line of shoes, launching a motorcycle racing team, and staying active on social media. These projects have made Paris Hilton a well-known businesswoman.

Recently Hilton decided to endorse ICOs (initial coin offerings). Hilton announced in September 2017 that she was going to be participating in LydianCoin, which is a platform that seeks to combine the blockchain with AI-driven digital marketing and advertising services. LydianCoin stems from a company called Gravity4. Hilton joins the ranks of Floyd Mayweather and The Game for celebrities who have endorsed the platform. The company is looking to raise $100 million by selling 20 million coins for five dollars apiece. ICO projects have earned more than $1.8 billion since 2013 through funding.

Hilton has also spoken and spent time with those in the business such as former ehtereum COO Stephan Tual. She has posted pictures of their meetings on social media enthusing about “the new millennium of technology.”
