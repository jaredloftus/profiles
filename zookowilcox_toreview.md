## Bio
Born as Bryce Wilcox but currently using the pseudonym “Zooko Wilcox”, Wilcox is the founding member and chief executive officer of Zcash. Zcash (formerly known as Zerocash and Zerocoin) is a cryptocurrency that aims to better protect the anonymity and personal privacy of bitcoin users. The company launched in 2016 and works towards offering bitcoin users a place to maintain their privacy on public blockchains. Projects stemmed from Zcash such as the Zcash Foundation – a non-profit organization that launched in March 2017. 

Wilcox is also the creator of the Transitive Grace Period Public License. According to Wilcox, the basic idea behind the project is to offer a compromise of time after you distribute a proprietary derived work. The idea was to offer a year or two of additional time where businesspeople can make money on their derived work but the work will eventually need to be an open source.

Wilcox also has years of experience as a developer. He was a developer for MojoNation P2P system and he worked as the lead developer on Mnet Network. He also worked as a developer for the company SimpleGen. 

He has also been a co-author for several publications including BLAKE2 and SPHINCS. In addition to Zcash he also co-invented Tahoe-LAFS with Brian Warner and ARTP with Phil Zimmerman. In 2001 concept entitled Zooko’s Triangle was named after Wilcox and outlines the three main traits a network protocol identifier should seek. Wilcox, Aaron Swartz, and Mark Miller invented the concept.
