# The DAO Hacker (needs focusing on Hacker rather than organisation)

## Summary
The DAO, otherwise known as the decentralized autonomous organization, was an organization that acted as a set of smart contracts among users active on the Ethereum blockchain. The main purpose of The DAO was to offer transparency to its users as opposed to misleading any shareholders or investors.

## Bio
The DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) was an organization that did not have a personal address or anyone assigned to their management positions within their company. Rather, they acted as an Ether-based organization that held smart contracts among users active on the Ethereum blockchain. Together, the smart contracts amounted to a collection of by-laws to determine how investors possessing DAO tokens voted on decisions regarding the future of the company.

The DAO never took money from its consumers and investors; the company allowed for investors to obtain Dao tokens, which gave them access to participate in a voting process regarding certain companies and the future operations of The DAO. People were allowed to send money internationally to The DAO without the cause for revealing any information about themselves given that the company was run through code rather than human power. The idea was that anyone in possession of a DAO token owned The DAO together. 

However, The DAO was susceptible to misinformation and hacks given its reliance on its complex code. Chain analysis by Bok Consulting revealed in 2016 that a DAO hacker took 106,100 ETC from the organization and turned it into 2,333 ETC using different addresses. They then used Shapeshift to convert the currency, which gave them the potential to walk away with $100,000. 

The DAO did not survive the issues with its organization and has been pretty quiet since. Those who had DAO tokens will receive anywhere from 0% - 100% of their ether back, though their fate remains unknown. The DAO use their social media now to share successes from their former users.
