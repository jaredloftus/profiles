## Bio
Wladimir van der Laan currently acts as the lead maintainer for Bitcoin Core, a platform that not only helps to keep bitcoin decentralized but one that is programmed so sift through blockchain transactions in search of valid ones. From 2010 until 2014 Gavin Andresen acted as the lead maintainer of Bitcoin Core and was once thought of to be bitcoin’s main developer. However, after he stepped down, van der Laan took over and has been in the position since April of 2014. 

Those who use Bitcoin Core are able to use features unavailable in other wallets such as better security, privacy features exclusive to the company, and a choice of user interface. 

Though van der Laan currently running Bitcoin Core and its Github, he has also spoken out about bitcoin scaling. In a 2015 email sent to CoinJournal he stated that his previous opinion regarding the issue remains. His stated he’s against unrealistic proposals that “bake in expected exponential bandwidth growth,” an opinion that received criticism from those claiming he was too conservative on the matter.  Due to the fact that bitcoin is a decentralized system, van der Laan believes that any code changes or BIP proposals need to be mutually agreed upon by core developers before ever being used.

He also works on bitcoin development with Andresen and Cory Fields.
