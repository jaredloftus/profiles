Bobby Lee started his career as a software engineer at Yahoo!, where he lead the development of some of the earliest online communities. In 2007 he moved from Silicon Valley to Shanghai, where he was Director of Software Engineering at EMC’s China Center of Excellence, focused on cloud computing and cloud storage.
