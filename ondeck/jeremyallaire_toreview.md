## Summary
Jeremy Allaire is the founder, chairman and CEO of Circle, a digital financial service provider making the use of digital currency easy and accessible.

## Bio
In 2013, Jeremy Allaire founded Circle – a consumer Internet company focused on transforming the world economy with secure, simple and less costly technology for storing and using money – and opened it up to the public in 2014. The HQ has moved from Dublin, Ireland to Boston, Massachusetts, where Allaire is based. In the beginning, Circle used bitcoin to transfer money between different currencies. Now, Circle only offers local currency to its users and refers people to Coinbase for bitcoin exchange. Behind the scenes, blockchain technology is still at the core of the product.

As one of the first people taking an interest in the Internet, Allaire founded his first startup, Allaire Corp., with his brother J.J. In 2001, Allaire Corp. merged with Macromedia. Allaire stayed on as the Chief Technology Officer, and was responsible for overseeing the development of Adoble Flash. Allaire went on and founded Brightcove, an online video platform. Once he switched from CEO to chairman, Allaire had the time to start paying close attention to digital currency, which led to the ideas for Circle.

Allaire has appeared in several (radio) interviews and conference discussions to discuss and promote blockchain and bitcoin. 

Allaire holds a Bachelor’s degree in Political Science, Economics and Philosophy from Macalester College.
