# Da Hongfei

## Summary
Da Hongfei is the founder of Chinese blockchain companies NEO and Onchain. He has also played a role in negotiating with the Chinese government about the future of cryptocurrencies in the country. 

## Bio
Da Hongfei founded Onchain in February 2014, along with CTO Erik Zhang and four others. Onchain designs blockchain solutions for businesses and is developing the DNA, or Distributed Networks Architecture, a blockchain that can be shaped to address various problems in the private and public sectors. 

Hongfei also founded Antshares, now NEO, at a similar time. Unlike Onchain, NEO is a community funded open-source project. It uses the same architecture and smart contract system as DNA, but is a permissionless blockchain. Hongfei is now developing NEOx a crosschain protocol, with the eventual possibility of integrating permissionless blockchain such as NEO with permissioned ones like DNA.

In 2016, during a partnership with Microsoft China, Onchain founded Legal Chain, targeting the inadequacies of the digital applications within the legal system.

Hongfei has also played a significant role in establishing a constructive line of communication between the blockchain community and Chinese government officials.

Prior to founding Onchain and NEO, Hongfei spent nine years as CEO of IntPass Consulting. He holds a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Technology and English from South China University of Technology.
