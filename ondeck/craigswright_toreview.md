## Bio
In 2016, Craig Wright published a series of articles claiming to be Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin’s mysterious founder. The claims were never proven, and many within the bitcoin community believed Wright was lying for personal gain.

Although Wright’s claims were greeted with scepticism from much of the bitcoin community, he had a number of prominent supporters, including bitcoin’s Chief Scientist Gavin Andresen and former board member Jon Matonis. Both Andresen and Matonis were reportedly given a private, in-person demonstration designed to prove Wright’s identity as the real Satoshi. Andresen later expressed regret at having become involved in the debate.

Before his Satoshi claims came to light, Wright’s background was in information security. In 1997 he founded an information security company, DeMorgan, in his native Australia. The company was involved with bitcoin and ‘next generation banking’. Wright went on to work for and head up a number of other digital security firms in Australia. He was the Asia Pacific Director for the Global Institute for Cyber Security and Research (GICSR) and led strategic development in the Asia Pacific region for the Centre for Strategic Cyberspace and Security Science (CSCSS). 

Wright taught a number of courses at SANS Institute, a training organisation for information security and cyber security. He was also an adjunct academic at Charles Sturt University in Australia. 

Since June 2015, Wright has been Chief Scientist at nChain, an organisation focused on research and development of blockchain technology.
