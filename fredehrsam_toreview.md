## Bio

Fred Ehrsam has managed to retire from a billion-dollar business less than five years after he founded it. He acquired an Honors B.S. in Computer Science and Economics from Duke University, then spent a summer researching nanostructures as a Computer Science Undergraduate Research Fellow before moving to New York to cut his teeth in the financial world with two years as a trader at Goldman Sachs.

In 2012, he crossed the continent to launch San Francisco-based Coinbase, which handles exchanges of bitcoin, ethereum and litecoin with fiat currency in dozens of countries. Nurtured in Y Combinator’s startup incubator, it quickly secured $31 million in funding, including a $25 million infusion via Andreessen Horowitz—at that time the largest funding for a company with a focus on bitcoin-style digital currency.

By 2013, he had already been named one of Time Magazine’s 30 People Under 30 Changing the World; the following year, he made the Forbes 30 Under 30 list.

In the summer of 2017, Forbes referred to Coinbase as “the main on-ramp in the United States from the traditional banking system to the world of crypto assets” and reported its valuation at a unicorn-level $1.6 billion, after it raised $100 million in Series D funding from IVP.

In a Medium post of January 2017, Ehrsam explained that he was changing roles at Coinbase to a board function because “Coinbase is strong” and “We are on our way to blockchains as the fabric of society…. It’s going to be a wild ride.”
