## Bio
Sunny Ray was born in Canada and studied electrical engineering at the University of Toronto and the University of Alberta. While he first worked in a financial brokerage, he came across bitcoin in 2011 and decided that he would make the move into the world of cryptocurrency. While bitcoin wasn’t large in India, Ray and his team decided to create their bitcoin company, Unocoin, which was a revolutionary move in the country due to the idea being the first of its kind in India.

Ray used his knowledge of the industry and finance to launch Unocoin. The company garnered attention from consumers in India and the company soon earned its place as one of the most popular bitcoin companies. Unocoin is now the leading bitcoin company in India and is a wallet service similar to Coinbase. Ray is not only the co-founder of the company but currently acts as the president of Unocoin. 

In a 2015 interview Ray said claimed that India was one of the biggest unbanked populations with 50% of the country being unbanked. He made it his mission and the mission of his company to change the numbers in India by introducing his company to the country. In the same interview he mentioned that being born in Canada to Indian parents he understands that India needs to catch up to the rest of the world regarding business models like cryptocurrencies. But, once they do catch up, there’s no stopping them.
