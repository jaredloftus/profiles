## Bio
Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym used by the unknown person, or people, who designed bitcoin and created its initial implementation.

In October 2008, Nakamoto published a white paper on a cryptography mailing list. The paper, titled ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’, described a decentralised monetary system.

Nakamoto released the genesis block for bitcoin in January 2009, containing the first 50BTC reward which remains unspendable. They published version 0.1 of the bitcoin software on Sourceforge a few days later. On 12th January 2009, Nakamoto sent the first bitcoin transaction to developer Hal Finney.

There has been much speculation about the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. Some sources have named early bitcoin developers and enthusiasts such as Hal Finney and Nick Szabo as possible Satoshis.

An article published in Newsweek in 2014 identified Dorian Nakamoto, a Japanese American man living in California, as Satoshi. Although he initially seemed to confirm the claim, Dorian Nakamoto later denied that he had any involvement in bitcoin.

In 2016, Australian computer scientist Craig Wright claimed to have cryptographic proof that he was the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Despite seeming to initially convince a number of people, including bitcoin core developer Gavin Andresen, Wright’s claims were never verified. 

The true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto remains unknown.
