## Bio
Jackson Palmer is the creator of Dogecoin, a ‘joke currency’ featuring the face of a Shiba Inu that is a satirical combination of bitcoin and the popular ‘Doge’ meme. Palmer created the cryptocurrency in 2013 to demonstrate the hype around bitcoin and the absurdity of investing huge sums of money in an unstable venture. 

While Palmer’s Dogecoin initially succeeded in engaging a community of users less interested in the serious investment side of cryptocurrency, it was eventually picked up by investors who drove its market value as high as $400 million USD. It also attracted scammers and hackers who left many of the currency’s original backers empty-handed. 

Palmer left Dogecoin in 2015 and continues to use his YouTube video series to attempt to refocus excitement onto the blockchain technology at the core of digital currency, rather than its market value. 

A graduate of Newcastle University in Australia, Palmer works as a product manager for creative cloud engagement growth at Adobe. He previously held a number of marketing roles with the software company.
