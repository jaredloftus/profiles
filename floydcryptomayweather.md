## Bio
In 2017, former professional boxer Floyd Mayweather promoted a number of initial coin offerings (ICOs) through his Twitter account, referring to himself as Floyd ‘Crypto’ Mayweather in place of his usual ‘Money’ pseudonym. The promotions were made as part of a deal with ICO marketing firm Crypto Media Group, with Mayweather one of the first high-profile names to be employed by the firm. 

After winning a number of Golden Gloves competitions as an amateur boxer, Mayweather turned professional in 1996, competing until 2007 and again from 2009-2015. He made a one-fight comeback in 2017, which was the background to his ICO promotions. He is one of the highest-earning sports personalities of all time.
