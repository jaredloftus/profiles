## Bio
Charlie Lee is the creator of litecoin, a peer-to-peer crypotocurrency. Lee developed litecoin while working as a software engineer at Google in 2011.  

In 2013, Lee left Google to join Coinbase, first as an engineering manager, later becoming Director of Engineering. He continued to work on litecoin during this time. 

In May 2017, litecoin activated the Segregated Witness (SegWit) code upgrade and saw a renewed interest from investors and developers. This prompted Lee to leave his role at Coinbase to focus on the litecoin project full time. 

Prior to joining Google, Lee worked as an engineer for Kana Communications and Guidewire Software. He holds a Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
