## Bio
Born as Bryce Wilcox but currently using the pseudonym “Zooko”, Wilcox-O'Hearn is the founder and CEO of Zcash. Zcash (formerly known as Zerocash and Zerocoin) is a cryptocurrency that aims to better protect the anonymity and personal privacy of bitcoin users. The company launched in 2016 and works towards offering bitcoin users a place to maintain their privacy on public blockchains. Projects stemmed from Zcash such as the Zcash Foundation, a non-profit organization that launched in March 2017. 

Wilcox-O'Hearn is also the founder and former CEO of Least Authority Enterprises, which is building an ethical and sustainable data storage solution. Least Authority Enterprises uses the Tahoe Least-Authority File Store (or Tahoe-LAFS), a free and open-source cloud storage system with end-to-end security co-created by Wilcox-O'Hearn.

Wilcox-O'Hearn is known for his work as a developer on DigiCash, Mojo Nation, ZRTP, BLAKE2, and SPHINCS. He is also the creator of the Transitive Grace Period Public Licence (TGPPL) license for making material open-source.

In 2001, he co-created the Zooko’s Triangle concept, which describes three properties considered desirable for names of participants in a network protocol: human-meaningful, secure and decentralized. Wilcox-O'Hearn conjectured that no single name can exhibit more than two of the properties, though this has since been disproven.
