# Wladimir van der Laan

## Summary
Wladimir van der Laan has been the lead maintainer of bitcoin core since 2014. He is also a developer at the MIT Digital Currency Initiative. 

## Bio
Wladimir van der Laan currently acts as the lead maintainer for bitcoin core, replacing Gavin Andresen in April 2014. The role involves reviewing code, troubleshooting bugs, software testing, communicating with open source contributors, as well as coordinating the release process. 

With a background in computer science and embedded software development, van der Laan first became involved with the bitcoin project by re-implementing and improving the bitcoin core user interface. He is also a developer at the MIT Digital Currency Initiative. 

Van der Laan has spoken out about bitcoin scaling. In a 2015 email sent to CoinJournal he stated that he is against unrealistic proposals that “bake in expected exponential bandwidth growth”, an opinion that received criticism from those claiming he was too conservative on the matter.  Due to the fact that bitcoin is a decentralized system, van der Laan believes that any code changes or BIP proposals need to be mutually agreed upon by core developers before ever being used.

Van der Laan also works on bitcoin development with Andresen and Cory Fields.
