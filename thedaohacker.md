# The DAO Hacker

## Summary
The DAO Hacker is an unknown person, or people, who drained 3.6m ether from the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO).
## Bio
The DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) was a distributed organization with no single leader governed by smart contracts. It functioned like an investor-run venture fund, based on the ethereum blockchain. The DAO launched on 30th April 2016, raising USD$150 million in its 28-day funding window.

Following the initial coin offering (ICO), a number of vulnerabilities were identified in the DAO's code. While programmers were working to fix the issues, an unknown hacker began draining ether from the funds gathered during the ICO. By 18th June 2016, the attacker had stolen more than 3.6m ether, draining it into a “child DAO” that has the same structure as The DAO. The price of ether dropped from over $20 to under $13.

An open letter to the crypto community, ostensibly written by the hacker, was subsequently posted, with the hacker defending their actions by saying they made use of a feature that was available on the platform.
