CEO, Kik

## Summary
Toronto-born Ted Livingston is the founder and current CEO of KIK, a free mobile messaging service that has approximately 300 million users to date. 

## Bio
Titan of industry Ted Livingston created Kik, the free mobile messaging service, in 2010 when he was undergoing his degree at the University of Waterloo for mechatronics. Livingston once worked as an intern for Blackberry, which was the spark for his decision to create his own messaging service. 
	In 2014, Livingston was featured in the Forbes Top 30 Under 30 list, where he ranked #20 at just 26 years old. Back then Forbes reported that Kik had 100 million users and was on the rise for more. To date, Kik now has 300 million active users, a 60 million user increase from the number reported in 2016. Livingston also earned a place on Toronto Life’s list in 2015. He placed 20th in the publication’s list of “Toronto’s 50 Most Influential.” At the time, Kik was just launching a new office in Los Angeles that was meant to expand the platform onto new web services.
Livingston’s work in the industry placed him among some of the well-known leaders of social media such as Facebook and WeChat. In 2015, the parent company of WeChat, Tencent, offered Kik a $50 million investment. To date, Kik Messenger is worth one billion dollars.
Livingston announced that Kik will also be releasing their own form of cryptocurrency called Kin, said to be launched off the Ethereum blockchain. The sale of Kin is expected to raise $125 million and will fund the next stages of the messaging platform: the Kin Ecosystem. With this decision to introduce Kin, Kik Messaging becomes the first non-blockchain social media platform to create its own digital currency.
