## Bio
Dr. Patrick M. Byrne founded Overstock.com in 1999. The company was one of the first to accept bitcoin as a means of payment. Byrne has since been acting as the CEO and formerly served as the chairman of the board. In 2013, Overstock.com offered its employees the option to receive payment in bitcoin. Bonuses are paid out to some of the company's employees using bitcoin, which is part of Byrne's plan to welcome the transition into using bitcoin. It was also one of the first companies to go public using a system that retained a greater share of capital within the company as opposed to using investment bank underwriters.

He has acted as an advocate for bitcoin and the blockchain for years. In a televised appearance on Fox Business, Byrne defended bitcoin in light of accusations that the currency was a fraud and addressed China’s concerns regarding the currency. In 2005, he also ran a campaign against illegal naked short selling.

Byrne has previously worked with Feccheimer where he served as the president and chief executive officer from 1997 to 1999. He also served as the chairman, chief executive officer, and president for Centricut, LLC from 1994 – 1999.

Byrne has a B.A. in Chinese studies and philosophy from Dartmouth in 1985, an M.A. in philosophy from the University of Cambridge in 1989, and earned his Doctor of Philosophy from Stanford University in 1996.
