# Instructions

*Please read all instructions before you begin.*

* The goal of this project is to provide accurate, well written, complete profiles for all public figures in the field of blockchain technology.
* Each profile consists of a number of fields 
* The file `_template.md` contains a list of these fields. The very first line is the person's name. After that, the information goes below the headers (marked by the line with two hashmarks) 
* To suggest a profile, open an [issue here at GitHub](https://github.com/EveryBit-com/profiles/issues) with the person's name
* To create a new profile of someone listed in in Profile Candidates section at the bottom of this README:
	* Pick a name. Create a new file in the `ondeck` folder with the name `personname_inprocess.md` and begin work on that profile. `personname` should be that person's full name, all lowercase, no spaces, and convert any non-ascii characters to the closest ascii equivalent you can find. 
	* Copy the text from `_template.md` into this new file
	* Fill in as many of the fields as you can. Note the `Sources` field at the bottom (use - + space to make bullet points). Make sure to include any URL's you have used for information about the person. Also, note the `Tags` field. Create tags for the technologies and projects this person has worked on. Make sure the final tag ends with a , and please include the person's primary location if you are able to find that.
	* The main `Bio` field should be about 250 words long (approx. three or four nice parragraphs).
	* The `Summary` field should be two sentences. 
	* Please do not mark more than one file as `_inprocess.md` at once.
	* Remove any fields you are leaving blank.
	* Once done with the profile, change the filename to end with `_toreview.md` and "commit" the changes.
	* Profiles maked `_inprocess` for more than a day may be taken over by someone else. 
* To edit an existing profile to make a correction or add information:
	* Edit the profile
	* Submit a pull request

Some additional style notes:
* Writing style: should be fairly formal, fact-based and as precise as possible. Avoid overly-long sentences or paragraphs. Try not to use qualifying adjectives (e.g. influential, foremost, successful) or non-neutral nouns (e.g. expert)
* Abbreviations: introduce the full term followed by the abbreviation in brackets the first time an abbreviation is used e.g. Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO)
* Capitalisation: Don't capitalise: names of digital currencies. Do capitalise company names, job titles (but not 'founder'), degree subjects and types (Bachelor's and Masters)
