## Bio

Vlad Zamfir is a researcher and analyst best known for his work with Ethereum, a company founded in 2014 that offers consumers the ability to codify, decentralize, and secure a variety of things. Ethereum allows for users to decentralize and trade voting, domain names, contracts, and intellectual property among other things. Ethereum also acts as a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts. The project was developed by the Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit foundation that devotes its time to support Ethereum platform research. 

Zamfir is also known for his work with cryptoeconomics, and blockchain sharding within the Ethereum ecosystem. He believes that “cryptoeconomics is like a mechanism design added to the cryptographer/distributed systems like toolbox.” He also considers himself to be someone interested in and concerned with the ethics and use of blockchain technology. 

He earned his B.A. in mathematics from the University of Guelph in 2012 and used to be a snowboarding instructor in Quebec from 2004 to 2008. He devotes much of his recreational time to mathematics and statistics and is an active blogger for Medium. Zamfir has also been featured on programs such as Bitcoin Uncensored and Epicenter, and has spoken at DEVCON. He’s also spoken with Haseeb Qureshi for Software Engineering Daily where the two discussed game theory, cryptoeconomics, bitcoin, and blockchain.
