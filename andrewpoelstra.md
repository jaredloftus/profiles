## Bio
Mathematician Andrew Poelstra is a key figure in the development of Mimblewimble, an alternative to the bitcoin blockchain. Following the anonymous posting of the Mimblewimble white paper in 2016, Poelstra became involved in its real world development, presenting on the work at Stanford University’s Blockchain Protocol Analysis and Security Engineering in January 2017.

Mimblewimble involves a slimming down of the bitcoin protocol that could increase privacy, fungibility and scalability of bitcoin’s current blockchain architecture. It uses a blinding element to obscure all values – transaction amounts and keys – to make transactions completely private.

Poelstra is a mathematician at Blockchain, where he worked with co-founders Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille in developing the high-performance cryptography library libsecp256k1. 

Poelstra graduated from Simon Fraser University in 2013 with a BSc in Mathematics. While completing his Mathematics MA at the University of Texas at Austin, he wrote and co-wrote several papers about bitcoin, practical cryptography and mathematics.
