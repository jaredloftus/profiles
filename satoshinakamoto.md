# Satoshi Nakamoto

## Summary
Satoshi Nakamoto is the pseudonym used by the unknown person, or people, who designed bitcoin and created its initial implementation. Nakamoto’s true identity remains unknown. 

## Bio
In October 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper on a cryptography mailing list. The paper, titled ‘Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System’, was the first description of a decentralised monetary system that would later be realised as bitcoin.

Nakamoto released the genesis block for bitcoin in January 2009, containing the first 50BTC reward which remains unspendable. They published version 0.1 of the bitcoin software on Sourceforge a few days later. On 12th January 2009, Nakamoto sent the first bitcoin transaction to developer Hal Finney.

Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym. Analysis has been carried out of Nakamoto's communications, however the true identity of the person or people behind the name is unknown. 

There has been much speculation about who the 'real' Satoshi is, with bitcoin developers and enthusiasts such as Hal Finney and Nick Szabo repeatedly being names as possible Satoshis.

An article published in *Newsweek* in 2014 identified Dorian Nakamoto, a Japanese American man living in California, as Satoshi. Although he initially seemed to confirm the claim, Dorian Nakamoto later denied that he had any involvement in bitcoin.

In 2016, Australian computer scientist Craig Wright claimed to have cryptographic proof that he was the real Satoshi Nakamoto. Despite seeming to initially convince a number of people, including bitcoin core developer Gavin Andresen, Wright’s claims were never verified.
