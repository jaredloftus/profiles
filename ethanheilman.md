## Bio
Ethan Heilman is research fellow at Boston University, focused on blockchain, bitcoin and peer-to-peer networks. 

Heilman is a co-author of Tumblebit, an anonymous payments protocol that uses a trustless mixer to facilitate increased privacy and anonymity in digital currency transactions. In August 2017, the Tumblebit protocol was fully implemented into the Stratis Platformâ€™s Breeze Wallet. It is also compatible with the Bitcoin protocol.

In June 2017, Heilman founded Commonwealth Crypto, which designs and builds layer-two blockchains that enable faster, cheaper, and more secure payments and cross-blockchain exchanges. 

Heilman is a research fellow with the DAGlabs project (previously Paragon Foundation), where he is part of a founding team that includes SPECTRE co-authors Yonatan Sompolinsky and Yoad Lewenberg. DAGlabs aims to create a new, more scalable cryptocurrency using directed acyclic graphs of blocks, or blockDAGs, rather than a blockchain.

Previously, he worked as a software developer at The Broad Institute, and start-ups Pubget and Jumptap.
