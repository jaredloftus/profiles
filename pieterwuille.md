## Bio
Peter Wuille has been a bitcoin core developer since 2011, having first discovered the cryptocurrency in 2010. His work on bitcoin core includes rewriting parts of the reference clientâ€™s code, and writing Bitcoin Improvement Proposals 30, 32, 42 and 62. He is also the primary author of libsecp256k1, a library for efficient elliptic curve cryptography for use in bitcoin. 

Wuille is one of the main developers involved in the development of Segregated Witness, first introducing the proposal at the 2015 Scaling Bitcoin conference. SegWit improves the Bitcoin protocol by decreasing the amount of data used by each transaction, effectively increasing transaction capacity without the need for a hard fork. 

Wuille is also one of the co-founders and an Infrastructure Tech Engineer at Blockstream, which builds open source software and infrastructure for Bitcoin, including the lightning network and sidechains. 

Before Blockstream, Wuille worked as a Site Reliability Engineer at Google. 

He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science, focused on programming language design, from the University of Leuven in Belgium.
