## Summary
Charlie Shrem is a bitcoin pioneer and crypto advisor. He is a founder of the Bitcoin Foundation and was previously the CEO of BitInstant. 

## Bio
Charlie Shrem established one of the first bitcoin companies in 2011 while completing his Bachelor’s degree in Economics and Finance at City University of New York. BitInstant, co-founded with Gareth Nelson, provided rapid transfers of funds between and into bitcoin exchanges, and attracted investment from high profile figures such as Roger Ver and the Winklevoss twins. 

During his time with Bitinstant, Shrem was investigated for violating anti-money laundering duties by dealing with Robert Faiella (alias BTCKing), who resold bitcoin purchased through BitInstant to users of Silk Road, an underground marketplace known for illegal activity. 

In 2014, with the investigation ongoing, Shrem stepped down from his role as the company’s CEO to focus on legal matters. He was charged with aiding and abetting the operation of an unlicensed money transmitting business in December 2014, and sentenced to two years in prison. He was released in June 2016, having served 15 months of his sentence. 

Following his release from prison, Shrem announced a new venture, Intellisys Capital, with Shrem serving as CTO, alongside co-founder and CEO Jason Granger. The proposed fund was dissolved in March 2017. Shrem subsequently acted as the COO of Decentral, a Toronto-based blockchain innovation hub run by Anthony Di Iorio. He was also COO of Di Iorio’s Jaxx digital wallet company until December 2017.  

Shrem continues to advise a number of crypto companies including InsurePal and Changelly. He is currently running CryptoIQ, a crypto investment advice service co-founded with wealth advisor Randall Oser. He is also the Founding Director of the Bitcoin Foundation, having served as its Vice Chairman until 2014.
