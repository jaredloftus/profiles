## Bio
Nick Szabo is a computer scientist, legal scholar and cryptographer known for his pioneering research in digital contracts and cryptocurrency. 

Szabo developed the concept of smart contracts, self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into lines of code. Smart contracts are primarily used in cryptocurrency protocols.

Szabo is also the designer of bit gold, a proposed mechanism for a decentralized digital currency. First proposed in 1998, bit gold was never built, but is widely considered to be a precursor to bitcoin. 

In 2014, Szabo spent a few months working for Vaurum, a start-up developing a new bitcoin exchnage platform now rebranded as Mirror.

In 2017, Szabo and former Stanford engineer Elaine Ou introduced a working method of securely sending bitcoin transactions over radio signals, which would allow users to circumvent potential restrictions on bitcoin internet exchanges.

It has been speculated that Szabo could be the person behind the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym.
